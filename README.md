Cycle.js Starter
================

Just getting a cycle.js app building can take some time. This repo is meant to provide a working starting point for a cycle.js app using Babel to compile ES2015 to ES5, webpack to bundle the modules into a script and gulp to orchestrate the build process.

The build produces a single bundled script in `browser/bundle.js`.

Usage
-----

Install gulp:

    npm install -g gulp

Install dependencies:

    npm install

Build:

    gulp

Then open `index.html` in your browser.
